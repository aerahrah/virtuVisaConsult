              <h2>EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT</h2>
              <p>
                The first step is picking a program that fits your education and
                immigration needs. We'll help you pick the best school and
                program for you based on your qualifications, your preferences,
                and the standard requirements. Our team will suggest options
                that will give you the best chance of getting a Letter of
                Acceptance (LOA) from a designated learning institution in
                Canada.

              <h2>SCHOOL APPLICATION MANAGEMENT</h2>
              <p>
                The second step is creating a student profile on ApplyBoard.
                We'll take care of all document submissions, verifications, and
                communication with your chosen institutions to make sure you
                don't miss any deadlines. We also offer no-cost consultations to
                help you work through any problems that may arise.

              <h2>IMMIGRATION CONSULTATION</h2>
              <p>
                Once you have an LOA from a designated learning institution in
                Canada, you will need to apply for a study permit. We've teamed
                up with licensed immigration consultants to provide expert
                advice. The initial immigration consultation includes an
                evaluation of your profile as well as information on what you'll
                need to prepare.
